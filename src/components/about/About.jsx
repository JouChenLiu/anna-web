    我是劉柔辰，畢業於國立中央大學資訊管理學系，目前就讀臺灣科技大學資訊管理系碩士班。 我喜歡探索資訊技術與應用發展，勇於接受挑戰，樂於學習新事物、將服務社會的熱情付諸行動。
    <br />
    大學期間，除了本系課程，我還有修習『第二專長–資訊工程程式設計』系列課程，學習跨領域知識及實作的能力，擅長的語言為 Python, JAVA, C#，有軟體開發、前後端開發、Android Application 開發和資料分析的能力與實作​經驗。大學畢業專題是製作一款結合音樂與情緒分析的個人化情緒陪伴APP，在團隊中，我主要負責歌詞情緒分析、設計統整心情變化的函數、前端介面設計與部分前後端連接，專題競賽獲得『中央資管專題競賽-第二名』、『大專校院資訊應用服務創新競賽-佳作』。
    <br />
    我的碩士研究領域為 Quantum Network (量子網路)，特別聚焦在量子網路的路由設計和最大化吞吐量等相關議題上。在研究中，以量子位元和量子閘為基礎，探索如何設計高效的量子網路拓樸結構，以降低通信延遲並提升網路性能，同時，關注如何最大化量子通信網路的整體吞吐量，考慮不同協議和通信場景下的最佳化問題。此外，目前也持續學習機器學習、資料探勘、資安議題、軟體工程、多媒體系統等專業知識和實作技能，以更全面地提升資訊能力和視野。

    My name is Jou Chen, Liu. I am passionate about exploring the development of information technology and applications, embracing challenges, and enthusiastic about learning new things. Also, I put my passion for serving society into action.
    <br />
    My undergraduate project is to create a personalized emotional companion APP that combines music and emotion analysis. In the team, I was mainly responsible for lyric emotion analysis, designing functions for integrating mood changes, some front-end and back-end. Also, the project won the "International ICT Innovative Services Awards 2022".
    <br />
    My research area for my master's degree is Quantum Networks, with a special focus on routing design and maximizing throughput in quantum networks. In my research, based on quantum bits (qubits) and quantum gates, I explore how to design efficient quantum network topologies to reduce communication latency and improve network performance. I also focus on maximizing the overall throughput of quantum communication networks, considering optimization issues under different protocols and communication scenarios. In addition, I am continuously learning professional knowledge and practical skills such as machine learning, data mining, cybersecurity, software engineering, multimedia systems, etc., to comprehensively enhance my information capabilities and broaden my perspective.
